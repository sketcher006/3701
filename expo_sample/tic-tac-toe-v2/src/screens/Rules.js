                    Objective: The objective of Tic Tac Toe is to get three of 
                    your own symbols (traditionally X or O) in a row, either 
                    horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on a 3x3 grid.

                    Players: Tic Tac Toe is typically played by two players, 
                    who take turns marking empty cells on the grid.

                <Text style={styles.blockText}>
                    Starting Position: The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.

                <Text style={styles.blockText}>
                    Gameplay: Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an 
                    empty cell of the grid. The first player typically uses X, 
                    and the second player uses O. Once a player places their 
                    symbol in a cell, they cannot move it.

                <Text style={styles.blockText}>
                    Winning: The game is won when one player successfully places 
                    three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, 
                    vertically, or diagonally. If a player achieves this, they 
                    are declared the winner, and the game ends.

                <Text style={styles.blockText}>
                    Draw: If all cells on the grid are filled, and no player has 
                    achieved three in a row, the game is a draw. In a draw, 
                    neither player wins, and the game ends.

                <Text style={styles.blockText}>
                    Ending the Game: The game ends when one player wins or when 
                    the game is a draw. After the game ends, players may choose 
                    to play again.
