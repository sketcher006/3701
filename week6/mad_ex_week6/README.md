# Week 6 Regular Expression and Fetch API

This project contains exercises for Week 6 of the Mobile Application Development course. It covers Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Visual Studio Code and Node.js installed on your computer.

### Installing

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LarryAtGU/mad_ex_week6.git
cd mad_ex_week6
npm install
```

### Files

This project includes several files; three require your attention:

- `questions.js`: The primary file you'll edit, containing instructions for the exercises.
- `ex.test.js`: Contains test cases. Your goal is to pass all these tests. Avoid modifying this file.

### Check your work

After updating the `questions.js` file, use the command below to execute all tests and verify your changes:

```bash
npm test
```

To run tests for individual questions, you can use specific commands as shown below. This approach allows you to focus on a single question at a time:

```bash
npm run test1
```

There are five separate tests available, corresponding to each question: `test1`, `test2`, `test3`, `test4`, and `test5`. Each command will run the tests related to a specific question, allowing targeted testing and debugging.

If all tests pass (everything is green), congratulations, you've successfully completed the exercises! If there are any failures (red), read the error messages to identify the issue and make necessary corrections in questions.js.
